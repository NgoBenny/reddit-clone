# Common

A full-stack community discussion app built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. Users can sign in through Kinde, create communities, publish rich-text or image posts, comment, and toggle upvotes or downvotes. Prisma-backed server actions persist these interactions, while paginated feeds and Tailwind CSS components provide the browsing interface.

The project brings authentication, relational data modeling, image uploads through UploadThing, and server-rendered pages together in one application.

Login explicitly opens Kinde's sign-in choices rather than silently reusing its SSO session. Signed-in users can select **Switch account** from the account menu. Existing sessions still persist during normal browsing.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

See [the audit and revival guide](AUDIT.md) for the deployment diagnosis, changes, and remaining feature backlog. Use Node 24.x, run `npm ci`, and copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` with your own Supabase, Kinde, and UploadThing settings. Run `npm run db:check` to verify database access before starting the app. Never commit `.env.local`.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The GitHub repository is `NgoBenny/common` and the Vercel project is `common`. The staged address [common-ngobenny.vercel.app](https://common-ngobenny.vercel.app) temporarily redirects to the existing production address until the Common release.

For the production address cutover, add `https://common-ngobenny.vercel.app/api/auth/kinde_callback` to Kinde's allowed callbacks and `https://common-ngobenny.vercel.app` to its logout allowlist. Set production `KINDE_SITE_URL` and `KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` to the new origin, and `KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` to its `/api/auth/creation` URL. Deploy the release, connect the Common domain to Production, and redirect the old domain to Common. Verify login, logout and account switching on the new origin before removing any old callback entries. Preview deployments need their own exact allowed origins and matching environment variables.

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
